DeepLabCut Project: Merging New Labeled Data, Retraining Network, and Analyzing New Videos
This script demonstrates how to merge newly labeled data with existing data, retrain the DeepLabCut (DLC) network, evaluate its performance, and analyze new videos. The process ensures the training continues from a specified snapshot without restarting, thus preserving the previously trained model's knowledge.

Steps Included in the Script
Create Training Dataset:
Merges all labeled data (old and new) and prepares the dataset for training.
Update pose_cfg.yaml:
Ensures the init_weights path points to the correct snapshot (snapshot-1000), avoiding the reset that happens when creating a new training dataset.
Train the Network:
Trains the network for an initial 2000 iterations, saving snapshots every 200 iterations. This step continues training from the previously specified snapshot.
Evaluate Network:
Evaluates the performance of the retrained network to ensure it meets the desired accuracy and performance metrics.
Analyze New Video:
Uses the retrained network to analyze a new video, producing a CSV file with tracking data.
Create Labeled Video:
Generates a labeled video to visualize the tracked points, aiding in the evaluation and presentation of results.
Code Description
The script follows these key steps:

Create Training Dataset:

python
Copy code
deeplabcut.create_training_dataset(config_path, num_shuffles=1)
This function merges all labeled data into a single training dataset.

Update pose_cfg.yaml:
Ensures the init_weights parameter in pose_cfg.yaml is correctly set to the desired snapshot:

python
Copy code
pose_cfg_path = r'E:\DLCModel_Retrain\ProjectFiles\xray_rat_hindlimb_cam1-Nathan-2021-11-17\dlc-models\iteration-1\xray_rat_hindlimb_cam1Nov17-trainset95shuffle1\train\pose_cfg.yaml'
with open(pose_cfg_path) as f:
    pose_cfg = yaml.safe_load(f)

pose_cfg['init_weights'] = r'E:/DLCModel_Retrain/ProjectFiles/xray_rat_hindlimb_cam1-Nathan-2021-11-17/dlc-models/iteration-1/xray_rat_hindlimb_cam1Nov17-trainset95shuffle1/train/snapshot-1000'

with open(pose_cfg_path, 'w') as f:
    yaml.safe_dump(pose_cfg, f)
Train the Network:
Continues training for 2000 iterations while saving every 200 iterations:

python
Copy code
deeplabcut.train_network(config_path, shuffle=1, displayiters=100, saveiters=200, maxiters=2000)
Evaluate Network:
Evaluates the performance of the retrained network:

python
Copy code
deeplabcut.evaluate_network(config_path, plotting=True)
Analyze New Video:
Analyzes a new video using the retrained network:

python
Copy code
new_video_path = [r'E:\DLCModel_Retrain\ProjectFiles\xray_rat_hindlimb_cam1-Nathan-2021-11-17\videos\2023-02-07_15-17_Evt01-Camera1.avi']
deeplabcut.analyze_videos(config_path, new_video_path, videotype='avi')
Create Labeled Video and CSV File:
Creates a labeled video and saves the tracking results as a CSV file:

python
Copy code
deeplabcut.create_labeled_video(config_path, new_video_path, videotype='avi', draw_skeleton=False, save_frames=False, codec='mp4v')
deeplabcut.create_video_with_all_detections(config_path, new_video_path, save_as_csv=True)
Requirements
DeepLabCut installed and configured
Properly labeled data in the specified directories
Correct paths set in config.yaml and pose_cfg.yaml
Usage
Clone or download this repository.
Ensure all paths in the script are correct.
Run the script in your Python environment to merge data, retrain the network, evaluate, and analyze new videos.
This script provides a comprehensive approach to managing DLC projects, ensuring continuous improvement of the model with new data and maintaining the integrity of the trained model.
